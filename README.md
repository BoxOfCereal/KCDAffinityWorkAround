console application to reset core affinities for KingdomCome:Deliverance PC

This does the exact same thing as opening up Task manager and selecting the affinities manually


This is a very hacky work around for the cpu affinity issue in KingdomCome: Deliverance for the PC as of 3/4/2018. 
It's not clean and has loads of uncommented code.

There are two major problems currently:
-4 cores are only supported
-The script does not dynamically check which core is at 100%





To use: Download the repository, navigate to /KCDWorkAround/KCDWorkAround/bin/Debug/ and run KCDWorkAround.exe
